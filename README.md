# project_airpollution_webgis
A WebGIS for Weather Temperature Monitoring

## User Story
As a citizen, I want to check the current temperature of my city and other cities I visit, so that I can stay informed about environmental conditions and health risks.

Note: Air Pollution requests from OpenWeather seems to be available only under payment.
